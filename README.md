### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the never ending project that is my footie livescores apps.
  - I started them a long time ago on Windows Phone and have tried so many times to port them to iOS & Android without success.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C through the edx CS50 program and it is fun and challenging even after 20 years as a developer.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I have been brewing beer since 2013
